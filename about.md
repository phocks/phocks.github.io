I am a guy who currently resides in Brisbane, Australia and builds things on the internet and resurrects dead computer systems.

You can find me most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phocks), [Instagrm](http://instagram.com/phocks), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/phocks), etc, etc, etc, etc. 

Or a plain old email would be great at [phocks@gmail.com](mailto:phocks@gmail.com)

This blog is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Oh yeah and my tweet archive is [here](https://phocks.github.io/tweets/).

That's about it. Thanks for reading.
