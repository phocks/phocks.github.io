title: WTF is this?

Well. Hello.

I figured it was about time I started up another blog.. So here it is!

As you can see it is still in its infancy, so there won't be too much here at the moment, but if you're just a little bit patient then there will be some additional content at a later date, very soon, so don't worry, and keep checking back every day until there is, or until you get bored.

You can also find me active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phocks), [Instagrm](http://instagram.com/phocks), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/phocks), [Tumblr](http://phocks.tumblr.com/), etc, etc, etc, etc. Or shoot me an email at [phocks@gmail.com](mailto:phocks@gmail.com)
