The other day my mate James asked me why it was (strangely) impossible to find my old band The Strange Attractors anywhere on the Internet. Especially for someone as extremely online&trade; as I was.

Good question Jimmy!

There was no [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/phocksx) back then. My old band sort of just slipped out of existence, except in memory.

So I've uploaded the album to YouTube for everyone. Enjoy!

On this record is me, Jeremy Sega Dreamboat Neale, Lauren Jenkins, Michael Fletcher, James Boyd, Neal Apel, and Jo-Jo P James.

Ahhhhh the memories! (Also subscribe to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshuaByrd)!!!)...
