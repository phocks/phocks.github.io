Me again. We've had a baby. Things have been hectic, but good.

I'm still software developing over at [ABC News](https://news.abc.net.au/).

I've written a few beginner coding articles over at [DEV.to](https://dev.to/phocks/). I thought I might repost them here too, over the next few days.

If you haven't already, please check out [Quoke](https://quoke.co) and give it a star [on GitHub](https://github.com/quoke/quoke.github.io).

Thanks a bunch, and see you soon.

Josh
