You can’t get the truth. You can’t. There’s a larger truth, though: that you can’t harness the forces of the cosmos, but you may find somebody else. You may find another human being. That may be kind of corny and all of that, but that’s what it is: **Love is the only truth** we can hope to know, as human beings. [That’s what Mulder and Scully found after nine years](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0819487/quotes?ref_=m_nm_trv_trv). And that’s a lot.

## Greetings from planet Earth

Has it been a month already? Alrighty then. Click our lady of scepticism above for this month’s spooky soundtrack.  
  
Most  **intelligent**  people will agree that  _The X-Files_  is the  [greatest television show](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/23/17989508/x-files-25th-anniversary-monsters-of-the-week-excerpt-todd-vanderwerff)  in history. We’ve been rewatching it recently—yes yet again.  
  
If you’re really bored you can [search Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aphocks%20x-files%20rewatch) and see me review each episode one by one.

Our daughter Vada was born on a  **full moon**  in August. And for her first 12 moons we would religiously  [keep count](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aphocks%20moon%20vada&src=typed_query&f=live)  before finally letting the tradition stray when she was a year old.  
  
Strange that a lunar month falls slightly shy of a regular calendar month. I had to work out this was her 18th lunar month by dividing her age in months by **0.970867**. I’m pretty sure that’s about right. Any math genius savants wanna correct me?  
  
So what on  **Earth**  have we been up to? The Moon has orbited the Earth yet again and this  **Moon**  month has been a blur.  
  
Oh yeah I randomly won a fancy clicky keyboard from a  [Twitch streamer named tashnarr](https://www.twitch.tv/tashnarr)  that is apparently worth over  **300**  bucks. Here it is in all its glory:
