> You can’t get the truth. You can’t. There’s a larger truth, though: that you can’t harness the forces of the cosmos, but you may find somebody else. You may find another human being. That may be kind of corny and all of that, but that’s what it is: **Love is the only truth** we can hope to know, as human beings. [That’s what Mulder and Scully found after nine years](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0819487/quotes?ref_=m_nm_trv_trv). And that’s a lot.

## Greetings from planet Earth

Has it been a month already? Alrighty then. Click our lady of scepticism above for this month’s spooky soundtrack.  
  
Most  **intelligent**  people will agree that  _The X-Files_  is the  [greatest television show](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/23/17989508/x-files-25th-anniversary-monsters-of-the-week-excerpt-todd-vanderwerff)  in history. We’ve been rewatching it recently—yes yet again.  
  
If you’re really bored you can [search Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aphocks%20x-files%20rewatch) and see me review each episode one by one.

## Happy Moonday

Look out the window right now. The moon is full once more in the sky and that means baby Vada is now 18 lunar months old.  

<img src="/public/img/full-moon-for-vada.jpg" width="450" />

Our daughter Vada was born on a  **full moon**  in August. And for her first 12 moons we would religiously  [keep count](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aphocks%20moon%20vada&src=typed_query&f=live)  before finally letting the tradition stray when she was a year old.  
  
Strange that a lunar month falls slightly shy of a regular calendar month. I had to work out this was her 18th lunar month by dividing her age in months by **0.970867**. I’m pretty sure that’s about right. Any math genius savants wanna correct me?  
  
So what on  **Earth**  have we been up to? The Moon has orbited the Earth yet again and this  **Moon**  month has been a blur.  
  
Oh yeah I randomly won a fancy clicky keyboard from a  [Twitch streamer named tashnarr](https://www.twitch.tv/tashnarr)  that is apparently worth over  **300**  bucks. Here it is in all its glory:

<img src="/public/img/tashnarr-keyboard.jpg" width="450" />

We also went to Chermside and Vada  [kept sliding down the fake grass](https://twitter.com/phocks/status/1229213368482852864?s=20) hills on her butt and it was pretty hilarious. Parenthood is a blast. 🤣  
  
Our  **Information is Beautiful** laser-cut award arrived for when we won  [BEST IN THE WORLD](https://about.abc.net.au/press-releases/abc-news-best-in-the-world-at-data-visualisation-and-digital-storytelling/)  at data visualisation and digital storytelling. Isn’t it pretty?  _(photo by  [Ben Spraggon](https://twitter.com/BSpraggon))_

We went to the newly renovated New Farm dog park and met a dog  [who looked almost exactly](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tVMu1XiGnCxsYrCN7)  like Misty.  
  
We started watching  _3rd Rock From the Sun_  and  [Vada loves dancing](https://twitter.com/phocks/status/1231768745992843264?s=20)  to the theme song.  
  
Aaaaaaaand we started our month-long and much needed social media detox.  
  
(Sorry no more  _X-Files_ reviews until April).

## Returning to Return of the Jedi

When I was a kid I had only one Star Wars movie on VHS and it was  _The Return of the Jedi_. It would be a while until I realised there were other Star Wars films as well—ones that didn’t involve Ewoks. What a shock to my adolescent mind.  
  
For Valentine’s Day we dropped Vada at her Grandma’s and took ourselves out to dinner for  [vegan ramen](https://www.zomato.com/brisbane/taros-ramen-south-brisbane) in South Brisbane.  
  
Afterwards we returned to my childhood to see a screening of  _Return of the Jedi_ at the Brisbane Convention Centre with orchestral backing by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra. It was  [out of this world](https://twitter.com/phocks/status/1228634355704057856?s=20)!

## Music to code to

I’ve found that movie soundtracks are really great to have on in the background while coding. Lately I can’t get enough of the [_Braveheart Original Motion Picture Soundtrack_](https://open.spotify.com/album/11RrIE8R4WdmybwaItRa97).  
  
Give it a go (and yeah I know Mel Gibson is cancelled but yeah this music really hits those nostalgic notes).  
  
Close your eyes and picture the **Scottish Highlands**.

## God is other people (or planets)

I finally finished re-reading  _Solaris_. I think I can now safely say it is my  **favourite** novel—besides  _Moby-Dick_  of course. I usually find translations a little awkward to read—and previous translations of  _Solaris_  were English translations of a French translation so [even Stanisław Lem called them terrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)#English_translation)—but this new  [Bill Johnston translation](https://amzn.to/2PY2cZH)  is all kinds of beautiful (currently available only on Kindle and audiobook).  
  
For those unfamiliar with the storyline it involves a dude called Kelvin who arrives at a station afloat on the ocean planet of Solaris and finds that there are mysterious “visitors” seemingly created by the planet itself.  
  
Okay after writing that last sentence I realise it’s virtually impossible to distil this book down to a few paragraphs. It deals with the nature of consciousness. It explores the  **unknowableness**  of intelligences apart from our own. It delves into how memory creates and influences perceptions and how we are all different versions of ourselves in the minds of others. And it describes a fallible and evolving proto-god reaching out for influence over the endless expanse of the universe.  
  
Anyway if that sounds like your kind of thing give it a read. If not then don’t 🤷

## Some links for the road

Oh the places you’ll go:

1.  We released our  [Bushfires from space](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-19/australia-bushfires-how-heat-and-drought-created-a-tinderbox/11976134)  story to much acclaim
2.  I did an  [angry tweet](https://twitter.com/phocks/status/1233297408269807617?s=20)  about the  **Copenhagen Interpretation**  of quantum mechanics and everyone should read  [this article about pilot-wave theory](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-new-quantum-reality/) that explains why quantum weirdness is totally unnecessary
3.  For those of you still not  **Feelin’ the Bern** [here’s a good article](https://theoutline.com/post/8766/its-sad-about-elizabeth-warren-but-its-time-to-go-full-bernie-sanders?utm_source=NL&zr=xfxuuo3e&zd=2&zi=5t5u57m7)  for you about Elizabeth Warren suspending her campaign
4.  I started playing chess online again because of  [this story about Magnus Carlson](https://slate.com/culture/2020/02/magnus-carlsen-speed-chess-drdrunkenstein-pseudonyms-twitch-youtube.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab) showboating multiple chess games while drunk livestreaming under the name DrDrunkenstein
5.  This old Buzzfeed News longread is also well worth a look:  [“Down The Rabbit Hole I Go”: How A Young Woman Followed Two Hackers’ Lies To Her Death](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/tomi-masters-down-the-rabbit-hole-i-go)
6.  And lastly—keeping with theme—if I were to join an  **alien cult**  (and honestly I’ve thought about it more than twice) I’d maybe go with this one: [I Went to a Raëlian Cult Protest for Titties](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mv5xq4/i-went-to-a-raelian-cult-protest-for-titties-432)

## Farewell dear friends

···

It’s just ticked past 2am and I’ve managed to get Vada to sleep again at last. The old hey Google play some “classical sleep music” trick seems to be working.  
  
The moon rises and falls as the world turns. It shows and hides its different faces to us as it makes its revolutions around us all. We all go through our phases.  
  
Until next time around.  
  
Goodbye moonchild. 🖤
