After an inexplicable absence (actually it was mostly because I was over in Europe) last year, I have decided to return to NaNoWriMo in 2015 to see if I still had it in me. It's day 5 and I've still not given up. I seem to even be on track somehow with the wordcount, having last night just broken 6666 words.

>The River winds on. A hundred thousand million billion trillion molecules of hydrogen atom pairs bonded to oxygen flow in millisecond intervals out to sea. Impurities abound, collected, deposited, added to along the way, from high mountain top rains through all the twists and turns of water cycle samsara. It’s a trap. We rise high; we trickle low.

>All the world is a window. Looking through, one warm, hazy October night was Willow. The ferris wheel had stopped, frozen in time. From that height, the river’s twin winding water-lines, both upstream and down met his field of vision, each meandering off into dual distant horizons. His own faded reflection in the window also bounced back against the glass. A chance percentage of photons flash-danced in quantum space, and returned back from where they came. The cityscape hung as a glowing red, green, & blue, neon, jagged backdrop against a dark sky.
