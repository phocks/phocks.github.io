Showcases are pretty dumb tbh. But I've decided to start making one anyway. It's pretty much the same thing as my other site [QuoteSwagga](http://quoteswag.ga). It's hosted on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) and uses a custom hacked html template.

Still working on it obviously and I want to try to get people to submit their own sites and have them come up as showcased websites.

Anyway here it is: [SiteSwagga](http://siteswag.ga) if you wanna chech it out.
