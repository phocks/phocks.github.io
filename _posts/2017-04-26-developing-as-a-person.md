title: Developing (as a person)

Maybe I should start writing this more like a proper personal journal. If I just write for myself and disregard the opinions of others then I'm sure to increase my output and flow. It's not like anyone is actually reading this anyway.

Yesterday was a public holiday for Anzac Day. Today is my first Wednesday not at work in a while. Late last year I made a resolution for change for the year to come. This is me following through with that idea. Now if I can only figure out which direction to take.

I guess for now it just comes down to whoever will take a chance in hiring me. With aspirations of building my own startup temporarily on hold for a while I guess my future is somewhat in the hands of others. But mostly I believe I'll be moving in the direction of becoming a true software developer.

So I'll keep on developing little projects at home. I'll keep on going through online learning courses like [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) and [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) etc. And I'll keep sending out my resume (CV) to places that look interesting.

Let's see if anything develops.
