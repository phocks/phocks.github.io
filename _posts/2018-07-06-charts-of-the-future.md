A few weeks ago at work we started doing a thing called [Chart of the Day](http://www.abc.net.au/news/story-streams/chart-of-the-day/) where we make a chart and publish it each day. It has been challenging but fun and a chance to learn more about data-journalism.

I wanted to share some of my attempts anyway:

1. [45 million Aussie bees buzz off to new Canadian home](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-22/chart-of-the-day-45-million-aussie-beez-buzz-off-to-canada/9777318)
2. [Winter is here but are things heating up in Australian bedrooms?](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-04/winter-is-here-but-are-things-heating-up-in-australian-bedrooms/9824422)
3. [Bitcoin is down 50 per cent, and that's not nearly the worst of it](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-18/the-biggest-cryptocurrencies-are-having-a-really-bad-year/9869314)
4. [Are you eating more veggies than a 3-year-old? Probably not](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-03/chart-of-the-day-are-you-eating-your-vegetables/9925782)

Well there you go. Hope you enjoyed.

If you have any ideas and data sources for charts please let me know!
