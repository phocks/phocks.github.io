On the 1st of December, 2014 I decided to have a break from social media. Way back in 2007 I [stumbled upon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumbler/phocks/comments) a little website called Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>setting up my twitter account</p>&mdash; ıllıllı joshua byrd (@phocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/phocks/status/46733802">May 2, 2007</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then I joined Facebook, later Instagram came along, and Tumblr, and about a million other online enterprises vying for my time.
