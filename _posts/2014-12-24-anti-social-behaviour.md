On the 1st of December, 2014 I decided to have a break from social media. Way back in 2007 I [stumbled upon](http://phocks.stumbleupon.com/) a little website called Twitter. Then I joined [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/phocks), later [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/phocks) came along, and of course [Tumblr](http://phocks.tumblr.com), and about a million other online enterprises vying for my time. 

After 7 years that initial spark had certainly dwindled. And so I got the idea late November that I wanted to see what it was like to not be beholden to these websites each day, just for a little while. 

Of course I didn't abstain from the internet completely. During the month away I have been looking for a new job, working on my own projects, and tending to other commitments. I also found that the fine line that distinguishes social media from the rest of the internet is often vaguely defined. In a way, email is the largest social media platform in the world. 

And now as the month wears thin and the time to return calls me back to the great social stream, I can appreciate the time spent apart. I did get quite a few things done that I wanted to get done without that additional undue distraction. But I also learnt that the art of procrastination in an ancient one and easily found even in the absence of a few major social media platforms.
