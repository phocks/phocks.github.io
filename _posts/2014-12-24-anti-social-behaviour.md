On the 1st of December, 2014 I decided to have a break from social media. Way back in 2007 I [stumbled upon](http://phocks.stumbleupon.com/) a little website called Twitter.

Then I joined [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/phocks), later [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/phocks) came along, and of course [Tumblr](http://phocks.tumblr.com), and about a million other online enterprises vying for my time. 

After 7 years that initial spark had certainly dwindled. For most of these sites I found that I was only updating them and checking them out of habit or because I felt almost obligated to. And so I got the idea late November that I wanted to see what it was like to not be beholden to these websites each day, just for a little while. I even went back to using my old Nokia phone with a whole week of battery life.

It was great! The taste of freedom!

Of course I didn't abstain from the internet completely. During the month away I have been looking for a new job, working on my own projects, and tending to other commitments. I also found that the fine line that distinguishes social media from the rest of the internet is often vaguely defined and that's what largely drew my excess attention. In a way, email is still the largest social media platform in the known universe. 

And now as the month wears thin and the time to return calls me back to the great social stream, I can appreciate the time spent apart. I did get quite a few things done that I wanted to get done without that additional undue distraction. But I also learnt that the art of procrastination in an ancient one and easily found even in the absence of a few major social media platforms.

In the end it doesn't matter how many social networks you are active on. In any life, Productivity and procrastination will forever be locked in that eternal battle for the mind and for all time.
