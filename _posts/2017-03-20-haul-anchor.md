Taking another look at [Anchor](https://anchor.fm), the internet audio, padcast app thing whatever it is.

I remember having the idea a long time ago what if there was a service like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/phocks) but for audio? Anyway I started even doing a little [SoundCloud account](https://soundcloud.com/xphocks) where I would record little updates on my phone and upload them.

I don't think anyone really ever listened to my inanities though, but it was kind of fun anyway. Anyway, then I heard that an app called Anchor FM had launched and it was pretty much exactly the same concept. It was actually pretty well made and had great onloading etc. But the problem was I think that no one really knew what to do with it. I tried staying on the platform doing updates whenever I could but then time crept by and I mostly forgot about it. A familiar story.

Just the other day though Anchor relaunched with version 2.0
