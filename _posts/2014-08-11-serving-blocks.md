title: Serving Blocks
---

Many years ago, at [@kattyzee](https://twitter.com/kattyzee)'s housewarming party in Melbourne, I met this random guy and on the balcony somehow we got talking about Minecraft, the game about [breaking and placing blocks](https://minecraft.net/), and fighting zombies in the night, or something like that. Anyway he ended up giving me his user details so I could give it a go. I tried, I really did, but I could never really get into it at all.

Now years later, and it's like the third highest selling video game of all time apparently. I thought that maybe running a Minecraft server on the old Linux VM would be a fun little distraction from the realities of existence. So I set one up.

I pretty much just folowed the [setting up a server](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server) guide on the BukkitWiki, except replacing the option `-o true` with `-o false` to put the server into offline mode. This lets you play with the cracked version of the client *(it seems my friend from long ago had changed his password somewhere along the line)*.

Anyway I'm currently running the latest version 1.7.10 and just messing around and trying not to die at night. I've worked out how to craft a few things, but I guess I still have a long way to go. Apparently you can venture down into the Netherworld and fight a big dragon or something later on in the game.

If you wanted to try joining `phocks.ddns.net:25565` to say hi and help build or destroy something, then don't hesitate. I should be in there unless I'm out or have had enough and decided to sort out my life finally.

But for now, here's a picture of a sunset from the top of a shelter that I built:
