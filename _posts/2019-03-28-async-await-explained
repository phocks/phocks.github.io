#async/await explained as simply as I humanly possibly can

Put `async` in front of a function.

eg. `async function test() {}` or `const test = async () => {}`

Now you can use `await` inside that function to pause and wait for values that take their time getting back to us.

Here's an async function:

```javascript
// Define our async function and let it use await
async function test() {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/"); // Wait for the Promise
  const json = await response.json(); // Wait to resolve the Promise
  console.log(json); // Log the response
}

test(); // Run the function
```

Okay that's it! Get it now?
