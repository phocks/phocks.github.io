So here's the customary *I never do these things* but, the other day I was tagged by [this pretty kitty](http://hellskittencouture.tumblr.com/) on [tumblr](http://phocks.tumblr.com), and I thought what the hell.

Quite surprised by what emerged in the end, like the draw of some musical tarrot cards or something. I wonder however just how much you can tell about a person from this.. have a listen anyway~!
