Last week I tweeted this after hitting send on an email to my cofounder explaining that it might be best if we call it a day.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">fail fast<br>fail early<br>fail often<br>fail cheap<br>fail gently<br>fail hard<br>fail easy<br>fail fair<br>fail better<br>fail forward<br><br>then...<br><br>fail at failing</p>&mdash; inglourious phocks (@phocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/phocks/status/800148048919732224">November 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

It has long been a mantra in the tech community apparently and for some reason it came to me mind and urged me to act. Sometimes things just don't go as planned. Events happen in the course of history and you can no longer let things linger. The more things you try the better chance something will stick.

So here I am now again waiting for inspiration. I see a vision of a certain future. But it is hazy. Here's a Twitter poll I just ran.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK Twitter help me with a dilemma this sounds trite but what&#39;s the best way to enact life changes and move towards your future dreams etc.?</p>&mdash; inglourious phocks (@phocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/phocks/status/803078863794278400">November 28, 2016</a></blockquote>

So it looks like I will take it slow for now, keep my head down and take small steps towards that hazy future. But once it comes into vision that's it. I'll drop everything and run with it. This is it.
