You've been able to [download your full Twitter archive](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160) for a few years now. This is great if you want to search locally through all your tweets. But what if you want to share your archive with the world?

Luckily [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers free hosting for static web pages. Here's how to quickly set this up. For now I'll be using the [desktop version of GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) but I might add in the commandline process at a later date.

Firstly you'll need a [GitHub](http://github.com) account so create one if you don't have one or log in and then create a new repository called "tweets" or something like that.
