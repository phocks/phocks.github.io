I'm writing this primarily for my own reference â€” so I don't forget how to do this for next time, but if you find it useful then that's cool. We're gonna set up an API with a free domain name and fully secured over HTTPS. Here we go!

I'll be running all this on my Google Cloud Compute instance. You can learn how to set one up for free using [this handy tutorial](https://phocks.github.io/a-free-google-server-forever.html) that I wrote last time.
