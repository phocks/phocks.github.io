title: Heavy Lifting
---

Second post, keeping it very brief as I have to be up tomorrow at 5am. Today I was helping out at [my old workplacee](http://www.karuna.org.au/) in Windsor. Tomorrow is their annual fundraising Art Market event, and I have agreed to open at dawn.

Helping with the setup today, a few hours heavy lifting the likes I hadn't seen in a long long while. A strange feeling being back.

I can even remember the very first Art Market we had, so many years ago. The sun coming up over the horizon to the east, a thin fog hanging low. I can smell the brisk air, almost, as though it was yesterday. 

But it isn't. We push forward. Laden, each carrying that weight of yesterday.

Tomorrow (a variation on a theme), is another day.
