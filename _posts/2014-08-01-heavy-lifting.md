Second post, keeping it very brief as I have to be up tomorrow at 5am. Today, helping out at [my old workplace](http://www.karuna.org.au/) in Windsor. Tomorrow is their annual fundraising Art Market event, and I have agreed to open at dawn—for purely nostalgic reasons.

Helping with the setup today, a few hours heavy lifting the likes I hadn't seen in a long long while. Summoned superhuman strength somehow. A strange feeling being back.

I can even remember the [very first](http://jb.phocks.org/2005/08/because-jesus-told-me-to-do-it.html) Art Market we had, so many years ago. The sun coming up over the horizon to the east, a thin fog hanging low. I can smell the brisk air, almost, as though it was yesterday. 

But it isn't. We push forward. Laden with [the weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_That_Weight) of a thousand yesterdays, carried a long time.

Tomorrow (variations on a theme), is another day.
