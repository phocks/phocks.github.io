So here's the customary *I never do these things* but, the other day I was tagged by [kelsey](http://hellskittencouture.tumblr.com/) on [tumblr](http://phocks.tumblr.com), and I thought what the hell. Quite surprised by what came out, like the draw of tarrot cards or something. I wonder what you can tell about me from this.. have a listen~!
