It's a little embarassing... but I've been on [twitter dot com](https://twitter.com/phocks) for over 11 years now.

I saw and retweeted this the other day and you know what? Maybe those onions are right. It's high time for a break. I've taken breaks before. Once for close to a whole month. I'm not sure how long this one will go for.

I wonder how many books I'll read.

### The dumpster fire that has become Twitter

I'm not sure how it came to be this way. Another embarrassment that I have to admit is I used to be one of those people who thought banning people from a platform was in some way restricting free speech.

I see now that this is not the case. For free speech to be preserved a platform must enforce a policy against hatred.

Twitter has increasingly shown that it is unwilling to do this.

I guess there's some catching up to do. For now Twitter is protecting hatred and abuse and is working actively against its own ordinary users.

Goodbye, for now little bluebird.
