It's been a long time since I rock 'n' rolled an actual blog. Back before [tweeting into the void](https:twitter.com/phocks) became the rage, and all those mindless hours [reblogging obscenities](http://phocks.tumblr.com) on tumblr, the internet was a simpler place. I chronically chronicled [a full year](http://jb.phocks.org/) in the infancy of Blogger; I ran bleeding edge subversions of WordPress installations, now [horribly outdated](http://phocks.org/historic).

This time I'm stripping it right down. Currently I'm typing this sentence into a text editor, and using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the static HTML code on [GitHub](https://github.com/phocks) (pretty cool huh lol).
