It's been a long time since I rock 'n' rolled an actual blog. 

Back before [tweeting into the void](https:twitter.com/phocks) became the rage, and all those mindless hours [reblogging obscenities](http://phocks.tumblr.com) on tumblr, the internet was a simpler place. I chronically chronicled [a full year](http://jb.phocks.org/) in the infancy of Blogger; I ran bleeding edge subversions of WordPress installations, now [horribly outdated](http://phocks.org/historic).

This time I'm stripping it right down. Currently typing this sentence into a text editor, and using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static HTML code pushed through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). A touch inconsequential though really.

The future unfolds. We are all travellers in time.

In forging ahead new pathways are formed. For the past few days I have been learning [this](http://youtu.be/FcOt6mfjxeA) song on the piano—a slow process as I am pretty terrible still—and day after day, note after painstaking note I can almost feel the neurons falling into line.

And in this way we too press on; we align. Pathways to the past. Branching untold futures.

A new dawning every day.
