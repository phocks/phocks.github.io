Curiouser and curiouser, so said Alice as she telescoped to nine feet tall. She ate her cake and you can too! Ever wanted to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) but didn't want to mess around installing complicated [command line ruby apps](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) and all that junk?

Well, you're in luck! Create your new blog in just three easy steps.

1. [Fork a copy](https://github.com/phocks/phocks.github.io) of this blog on GitHub (you have an account of course)
2. Rename your resulting repository to ```username.github.io``` (replacintg *username* with your username of course)
3. That's it, pretty much! (you'll probably want to edit/delete/add your own posts in the ```_posts``` directory and customise the ```_config.yaml``` file of course)

You can edit all of the site files directly on GitHub's web interface, or clone a copy locally.
