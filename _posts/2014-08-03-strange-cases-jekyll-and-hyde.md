title: Strange Cases&#58; Jekyll & Hyde

Curiouser and curiouser, so said Alice as she telescoped to nine feet tall. She ate her cake and you can too! Ever wanted to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) but didn't want to mess around installing complicated [command line ruby apps](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) and all that junk?

Well, you're in luck! Create your new blog in just three easy steps.

1. [Fork a copy](https://github.com/phocks/phocks.github.io) of this blog on GitHub (you have an account of course)
2. Rename your resulting repository to ```username.github.io``` (replacing *username* with your username of course)
3. That's it, pretty much! (you'll probably want to edit/delete/add your own posts in the ```_posts``` directory and customise the ```_config.yaml``` file of course)

Start sharing your new <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator. i.e. blahblah.github.io">URL</abbr>!

You can edit all of the site files directly on GitHub's web interface, or else clone a copy locally, and hack away. You might also wish to satiate your curiosity further by trying out some other Jekyll themes, [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) for example.

So anyway I'm about to begin reading [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141439734/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0141439734&linkCode=as2&tag=phocks-20&linkId=TTIKGAK5AAUWLA4V), which strangely enough, I have never read before. 'Till next time.
