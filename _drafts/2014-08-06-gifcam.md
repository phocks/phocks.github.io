I've tried it a few times. Making GIFs in Photoshop is pretty hard. You have to import the and trim the video, deal with the timeline and frames and and all that. And to do those sweet cinemagraph things you need to mess about with masking layers and often times it all gets a bit too much. 

Also I understand there are a few sites online that let you make GIFs, but they always slap their big ugly logo on to every frame, so they're pretty good candidates for avoidance most of the time.

Wouldn't it be great if there was something like this?:

Luckily it actually does exist! It's a little program called [GifCam](http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/) which simplifies the process a lot. You can [download it directly](http://www.bahraniapps.com/apps/gifcam/gifcam.php) from here and check it out.

Here's one I prepared earlier too:

ps. unfortunately it's only available for Windows right now.
